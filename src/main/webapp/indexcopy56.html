    <h2>Odo</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://odo.dev/">odo CLI tool</a> is a fast, iterative, and straightforward way for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift.  Existing tools such as kubectl and oc are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. The odo tool abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer.

        community with the aim of optimizing Enterprise Java for a microservices
